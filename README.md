Klaverjassen and logic
=============

Abstract
-------
This project is the implementation of a simulation of one hand of the Dutch card game Klaverjassen. 
It is generally played with two teams of two players each, totalling four players. 
The game uses 32 cards, every card from the 7 onward of all suits are used. 
A hand consits of eight tricks, with each trick points can be obtained by one of the teams. 
The player that plays the highest card wins the trick and all of the points attributed to the cards played in that trick. 
The program is implemented using <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>.

Downlaod and Run Instructions
-------
To run the simulation <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, version 2.7 or 3.5, and the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted" target="_blank">Pygame library</a> are required.
After downloading and unzipping the files from our repository, the simulation is started by executing `main.py` with Python.
- **MAC/Linux:** Open terminal in the folder that contains `main.py` and type `python main.py`.
- **Windows:** If Python installed correctly, simply double click `main.py`.
