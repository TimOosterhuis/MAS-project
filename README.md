Klaverjassen and logic
=============

Abstract
-------
This project is the implementation of a simulation of one hand of the Dutch card game Klaverjassen. 
It is generally played with four players and uses 32 cards. 
A hand consits of eight tricks, each trick points can be obtained. 
The player that plays the highest card wins the trick and all the points attributed to the cards in that trick. 
The program is implemented using <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>.
In addition to our program files, which can be downloaded by using one of the download buttons above,
you will also need <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> (either version 2.7 or 3.5) and the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted" target="_blank">Pygame Module</a> in order to run our program.
To run our logical klaverjas agents app, unzip the folder after downloading it and execute the `main.py` script with python.
On Mac/Linux run command: `python main.py` from the command prompt.
On windows the standard Python installer associates the .py extension with a python file, so you should be able to double click `main.py` in order to run it.

Downlaod and Run Instructions
-------
To run the simulation <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, version 2.7 or 3.5, and the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted" target="_blank">Pygame library</a> are required.
After downloading and unzipping the files from our repository, the simulation is started by executing `main.py` with Python.
- **MAC/Linux:** Open terminal in the folder that contains `main.py` and type `python main.py`.
- **Windows:** If Python installed correctly, simply double click `main.py`.
